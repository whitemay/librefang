// Query key factories — hierarchical pattern for precise invalidation.
//
// Convention:
//   all          → broadest prefix (for invalidateQueries({ queryKey: xxxKeys.all }))
//   lists()      → all list queries
//   list(filters) → specific list query
//   details()    → all detail queries
//   detail(id)   → specific detail query
//
// All arrays use `as const` for structural stability.
